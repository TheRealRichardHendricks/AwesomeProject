Here's the Register flow for the App. It is written in Javascript using Functional Components and Hooks.

Components are in **client/js/screens**. Structure of each Component is divided in three parts:

- styles.js (css and StyleSheet for Component)
- index.js (all functionalities, redux actions, other helper functions)
- ComponentName.jsx (pure ui of Component)

**Running on iOS**

```
react-native run-ios
```

or using my custom script

```
npm run ios
```

**Running on Android**

```
react-native run-android
```
